Test Document for AI Employee Processing

This is a sample document dropped into the Inbox folder to test the File System Watcher.

## Purpose
This document tests the Bronze Tier functionality:
1. File System Watcher detects the new file
2. Watcher copies file to Needs_Action with metadata
3. Orchestrator detects pending items and triggers Claude Code
4. Claude Code processes the file and moves to Done

## Test Instructions
1. Ensure filesystem_watcher.py is running
2. Copy this file to the /Inbox folder
3. Watch for the file to appear in /Needs_Action with a .md metadata file
4. Run Claude Code to process the item
5. Move completed items to /Done

## Expected Behavior
- File should be detected within 1-2 seconds
- Metadata file should contain original filename and size
- Orchestrator should create a Claude prompt
